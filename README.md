# Campus-Network-Design-and-Security
Graduation Project: Campus Network Infrastructure Design and Security

This repository showcases our team's graduation project, completed as part of the Digital Egypt Pioneers Initiative (DEPI). The project focuses on designing and securing a campus network infrastructure, applying advanced networking and security principles.

# Project Overview

Our project involves designing a secure and efficient campus network infrastructure using Cisco devices. It includes network planning, implementation, and security configurations, ensuring robust connectivity and protection against potential threats.

# Project Phases

1- Network Design and Configuration

- Defined network topology.
- Designed an IP addressing scheme.
- Configured Cisco devices (routers and switches).
  
2- LANs and Inter-VLAN Routing

- Configured VLANs and VLAN trunks.
- Implemented Inter-VLAN routing using the Router-on-a-Stick method.
- 
3- Network Security Implementation

- Applied port security on switches.
- Configured Access Control Lists (ACLs) for enhanced security.
- Hardened network devices.
  
4- Final Testing and Reporting

- Conducted network functionality and security testing.
- Prepared a final report covering network performance, security overview, and recommendations.
- Delivered a presentation on findings and outcomes.
  
# Technologies Used
- Cisco Devices: Routers and switches.
- Network Design Tools: Cisco Packet Tracer.
- Security Configurations: Port security, ACLs.
- Documentation: Network performance reports and presentations.
